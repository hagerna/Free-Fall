# Free-Fall
Free Fall is a 3-D Unity game where the player controls a falling ball and attempts to avoid obstacles and reach the bottom. The player has the chance to purchase upgrades after each failed attempt making future runs easier and faster.

Possible next steps that I may return to with this project are creating more levels, adjusting the difficulty, and adding other audio elements such as sound effects.
